# USAGE
***
Using method is equal to windows notepad!!  
But I introduce you some notice.  
## print
***
When you print, you'll see the dialog  
![dialog](print_one_page.PNG)  
You only see number 1, then you can print page up to 1 page.  
![dialog](print_more_page.PNG)  
Or you see '1-2' like this. Then you can print page up to 2 pages.
So don't modify max page over maximum page number.  
## change languages
***
When you want to change languages, you manually change your resource file.  
Maybe you cannot open resource file 'rsrc.rc' in the notepad folder. I don't know why this not open.  
So you open it with notepad.  
![language](change_language.PNG)  
You can change define in order to change language.  
Unless the language you want is there, you cannot choose it!
